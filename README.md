## Should we release it?

International workshop on the Critical Aspects of Releasing Open Source Software (CAReOSS)

Held in conjunction with the 14th International Conference on Open Source Systems ([OSS 2018](http://www.oss2018.org))

Sunday, June 10th 2018, Athens, Greece

### Call For Papers

Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) is playing an essential role
in the success of the large, complex and sophisticated
software solutions that we design, build and deploy today and its ongoing adoption among
businesses, governments, and other organizations offers a constantly expanding
ground for collaboration, business development and innovation. 

The workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners and members of the FLOSS
community to discuss the critical underpinnings of a decision to release software with a Free/Libre
Open Source License. The goal is to identify and elaborate on the pragmatic
concerns involved in the decision, covering aspects that include, but are not
limited to, the following:

* FLOSS and business models: Can it strengthen your business model, paving
 the way to new opportunities? 
* FLOSS and innovation: Is it suitable for an innovative startup or small
 company?
* FLOSS and licensing: Which license should you choose and what risks are
 involved, if any?
* FLOSS and communities: What social and technical skills are required to
 build an international FLOSS community?
* FLOSS and the software lifecycle: How FLOSS affects the software
development lifecycle (methodology, tooling, project governance and team management)? 
* FLOSS and sustainability: How does the cost of developing and maintaining FLOSS
 compares to developing and maintaining proprietary software? By and large, is
 FLOSS more sustainable than proprietary software?

The workshop seeks for contributions that will elaborate on the above or
related topics and discuss lessons learned, suggest best practices, report on
previous experience (reflecting on successes or failures), pinpoint anti-patterns,
and, ultimately, articulate the crucial issues to be taken under consideration by the
decision makers (such as software developers, product managers, business
stakeholders).
